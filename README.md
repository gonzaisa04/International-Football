# International Football
International football games are matches that bring high emotion to the sport. I used Jupiter/Python and Tabluea Public to create a fun and informational look at these matches.


## Key Questions

● What is/ if any the relationship between variables?

● Is there an advantage between the home and away team?

● How do matches play out?

● Who are the countries in international competitions?

● Who are the most resilient/clutch teams?

● Who are the highest goalscorers?

## Data & Tools

In this project, I was tasked to find data that was of interest. The files were all found on Kaggle.

● world-countries.json

● goalscorers

● results

● shootouts

This project used tools within python to create the charts and graphs. These tools include:

●  Pandas

● Seaborn

● Matplotlib

● Numpy

● SciPy

● SKLearn

● Pylab

## Folders

The project was organized in folders. The folders include:

● Project Management: Project Brief

● Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.

● Analysis: The visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.

# Visualizations
The visuals were created on Tableau Public and Jupiter/Python. These visuals can be found here: [Tableau Presentation](https://public.tableau.com/views/InternationalFootball_17120251874890/Story1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
